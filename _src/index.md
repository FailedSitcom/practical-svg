I wrote this book back in 2016. SVG wasn't new then, but it was starting to catch on a little bit more for front-end developers. I thought, and still think, SVG is a great tool for a lot of things on the web, and wanted to help keep that trend going.

### Thank You

Thanks to SVG advocates that have convinced me SVG is good and whom I learned all this from, like Lea Verou, Chris Lilley (who tech-edited this book and ushered SVG into existence), Val Head (who wrote the lovely introduction), Sara Soueidan, Amelia Bellamy-Royds, and Fabrice Weinberg (who wrote a tool based on a silly idea I had for a SVG build tool that really got my brain cooking).

Thanks to Jeff Eaton for [Dancing Queen](https://github.com/eaton/dq), the technical project that capably extracted the contents of the final `.epub` file that A Book Apart originally produced. And then Mat Marquis for building this Eleventy site that took those contents and made them into this nice website that I and other author's who had booked in the now-defunt A Book Apart world.
